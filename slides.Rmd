# Why Word of Mouth Matters

---
# What is Word of Mouth Marketing?

Consumer's interest in a company's product or service is reflected in their "daily dialogues"

* Why is this *new* in "social media"?
  * It isn't a new idea ...
  * The "social web" with it's increasing connectivity makes it more salient
  * ... and measurable

---
# Types of Word of Mouth 

**Organic word of mouth**:

* People become advocates for a product and have a desire to share their views.
* **This is our focus this week**

**Amplified word of mouth**: 

* Marketers launch campaigns designed to encourage or accelerate WoM in existing or new communities.
* We'll come back to this later in the course -- "Social Advertising"

**Online versus Offline**

* Distinction is always lurking in the background

---
# Social Media Word of Mouth Matters

* Consumers now spend more than 135 mins per day on social media
    - Social media sites contain a treasure-trove of decision relevant information
    - Twitter is the main platform for opinion exchange

* Social Media fostered growing importance of WoM marketing

* Chief Marketing Officers think online WoM matters
    - ... Rationalized by consumer's trust in online info from peers (Nielsen, 2013)
    - 64% of marketing executives believe word of mouth is the most effective form of marketing
    - Only 6% say they have mastered it.

# Why Social Media Might Matter:

Three mechanisms at play:

1. Awareness
2. Buzz
3. Social learning

Most often we see:

* Awareness & Buzz $\rightarrow$ volume of tweets
* Social learning $\rightarrow$ sentiment in tweet's text
  * Sentiment often called valence

---
# Tweet Volume Measures Awareness and Buzz

* Awareness
    * Introduces new consumers to a movie
    * Reminds consumers about movie
    * Reinforce traditional advertising
* Buzz: expressions of anticipation
    * Increase in anticipation $\rightarrow$ increase in volume of posts
        * By consumers who want to act as opinion leaders, and reflect their interests, excitement, and expectations
        * Generally "neutral" in sentiment

---
# Sentiment Measures Movie Quality

* Sentiment expressed tweet's text provides means to measure quality
* Tweet Sentiment impacts sales via social learning
    * Quality revealed through interactions with their peers
    * Relevant if consumer's use these reviews to decide what movie to attend

* Important to control for other ways consumers learn about movie quality

---
# Why Should We Care?

- Social media can generate awareness, buzz and information diffusion that ultimately influences demand
- Important when:
    1. Relying on "hyped release strategies"
    2. Uncertainty about a product's quality
- Examples: movies, books, consumer electronics, video games, fashion

# Twitter & Movies

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/twitter_movies.png")
```

# Searching for a "Twitter Effect"

**Motivation**: (Twitter) WoM and early product adoption

**Specific Questions**:

* Does Twitter WoM impact demand? (early adoption behaviour)
* Are there different effects for positive and negative Twitter comments?

**Industry**: US Movies, theatrical release

* A "favourite" for WoM research
* Buzz, awareness, uncertain quality all play a role

---
# Empirical Approach 


**Data**:

* Box Office earnings over opening weekend - Oct 2009 to Oct 2010
* Twitter posts in opening 24 hours, want volume *and* sentiment
* Info about movie characteristics (as control variables)
  * Including critic reviews *and* pre-release ad spending

**Empirical Approach**:

* Classify reviews as positive/negative/neutral
  * "Text-as-data" + machine learning
* Estimate a regression of "demand" on Twitter

# How Tweets Evolve

# Regression Framework

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tht_regression.png")
```

---
# Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="120%"}

```

# Mechanism

.center[**Why is there "Twitter Effects"?**]

* Survey Twitter users to find out..

**Findings**:

* Twitter users are movie go-ers
* Negative tweets stand out to them
  * Honest, different from positive marketing spin
* Twitter as a means to find information:
  1. First resort for movie information
  2. Tool to sway opinion
  3. As a fallback 
  4. Recommendations from friends
