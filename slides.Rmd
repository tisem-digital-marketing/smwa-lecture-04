# Why Word of Mouth Matters

---
# What is Word of Mouth Marketing?

Consumer's interest in a company's product or service is reflected in their "daily dialogues"

* Why is this *new* in "social media"?
  * It isn't a new idea ...
  * The "social web" with it's increasing connectivity makes it more salient
  * ... and measurable

---
# Types of Word of Mouth 

**Organic word of mouth**:

* People become advocates for a product and have a desire to share their views.
* **This is our focus this week**

**Amplified word of mouth**: 

* Marketers launch campaigns designed to encourage or accelerate WoM in existing or new communities.
* We'll come back to this later in the course -- "Social Advertising"

**Online versus Offline**

* Distinction is always lurking in the background

---
# Social Media Word of Mouth Matters

* Consumers now spend more than 135 mins per day on social media
    - Social media sites contain a treasure-trove of decision relevant information
    - Twitter is the main platform for opinion exchange

* Social Media fostered growing importance of WoM marketing

* Chief Marketing Officers think online WoM matters
    - ... Rationalized by consumer's trust in online info from peers (Nielsen, 2013)
    - 64% of marketing executives believe word of mouth is the most effective form of marketing
    - Only 6% say they have mastered it.

---
# Why Social Media Might Matter:

Three mechanisms at play:

1. Awareness
2. Buzz
3. Social learning

Most often we see:

* Awareness & Buzz $\rightarrow$ volume of tweets
* Social learning $\rightarrow$ sentiment in tweet's text
  * Sentiment often called valence

---
# Tweet Volume Measures Awareness and Buzz

* Awareness
    * Introduces new consumers to a movie
    * Reminds consumers about movie
    * Reinforce traditional advertising
* Buzz: expressions of anticipation
    * Increase in anticipation $\rightarrow$ increase in volume of posts
        * By consumers who want to act as opinion leaders, and reflect their interests, excitement, and expectations
        * Generally "neutral" in sentiment

---
# Sentiment Measures Movie Quality

* Sentiment expressed tweet's text provides means to measure quality
* Tweet Sentiment impacts sales via social learning
    * Quality revealed through interactions with their peers
    * Relevant if consumer's use these reviews to decide what movie to attend

* Important to control for other ways consumers learn about movie quality

---
# Why Should We Care?

- Social media can generate awareness, buzz and information diffusion that ultimately influences demand
- Important when:
    1. Relying on "hyped release strategies"
    2. Uncertainty about a product's quality
- Examples: movies, books, consumer electronics, video games, fashion

# What This Paper is About

.center[**Quantifying the impact of online WoM on new product performance**]

* Estimate demand elasticities w.r.t.:
    1. Volume of Tweets $\rightarrow$ Awareness & Buzz
    2. Tweet Sentiment $\rightarrow$ Information diffusion

* How:
    - Structural model of consumer demand
    - ... Control for endogenous advertising and offline WoM

* Application:
    - Movie Industry
    - Twitter

---
# Twitter & the Movie Industry

- Twitter is main online platform for movies (Twitter, 2014)
    - Sixth most discussed topic on Twitter (Hu et al, 2017)
    - $\approx 200,000$ tweets per day (Suslak, 2014)

* Nielsen surveys (2014/15) find Twitter users:
    - 340% more likely than non-users to have seen more than 12 movies over the last six months
    - Nearly twice as likely to see a film within 10 days of its opening
    - 87% of Twitter users recent movie attendance was influenced by tweets
    - 63% heard about movies through social media
    - Over half of movie-going Twitter users share their thoughts on Twitter after they leave the theater.

# Data Sources

US Movie Industry 2014 & 2015:

* Wide release movies - opened to at least 600 cinemas
* Released on a Friday
* 222 movies out of approx. 300 wide releases

Industry Data on:

1. Box Office & movie characteristics
2. Critic reviews
3. Consumer Reviews
4. Advertising Data
5. Ex-ante Box Office Predictions

---
# Data Sources: Twitter

Individual tweets about each movie from Twitterâ€™s Historical Powertrack

* Search for tweets about each movie using
    1. Movie name
    2. Relevant hashtags
    3. Movie franchise + Sequel indicators
* Baseline data: $\pm 6$ months from release date
    * Restrict to  60 days pre-release until end of the third weekend
    * 48 million movie relevant tweets
        - approx 300K per movie

---
# From Tweet Content to Tweet Sentiment

* VADER Sentiment Lexicon (Hutto & Gilbert 2014)

* Sentiment Lexicon:
    - Word list with semantic orientation: positive or negative
    - Strength of sentiment expressed

* VADER extends 'standard' lexicons for online language:
    1. Punctuation - exclamation marks strengthen sentiment
    2. Capitalization - all caps strengthens sentiment
    3. Emoticons

* Correlates well with human encoders across multiple domains, $corr > 0.88$
* Outperforms standard ML approaches (Riberio et al, 2016)

---
# Classifying Tweets with VADER

* VADER gives a score for each tweet $score \in [{-1}, 1]$
* We bin tweets into three categories:
    * Positive Tweet: $score \in [0.05, 1]$
    * Neutral Tweet: $score \in [{-0.05}, 0.05]$
    * Negative Tweet: $score \in [{-1}, -0.05]$

* **Main Output**:
    - number of tweets per category for each movie-day pair
    - Sentiment: positive-negative ratio

---
# Structural Model of Movie Demand

* Sliding Window Nested Logit Demand
    * Explicit assumptions about consumer preferences and decision making
    * 'Sliding Window' - frequent rotation of movies in and out of cinemas
    * Aggregate individual decisions to national market shares for estimation

* Notation:
    * $i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, M$ individuals
    * $t = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, T$ days
    * $j = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, J$ movies
        * $J_t$ is the set of movies that are currently in cinemas

Expected Performance Tier Fixed Effects, $\theta_s$
  * ... pre-release prediction from Hollywood Stock Exchange
  * We split expected box office in six tiers ...
  * ... Each tier has different levels of consumer buzz and awareness driven by offline WoM
  * Third set of controls to absorb offline WoM
  * Control for endogenous ad spending
    - high expected performance $\rightarrow$ large ad spend

# Takeways

Awareness, buzz and information diffusion channels from online WoM are important determinants of demand

On average, we find:

* Pre-release volume elasticity of 0.04
* Post-release volume elasticity of 0.08
* Post-release sentiment elasticity of 0.27

**Effects are small compared to existing literature**

---
# Takeways II

Important heterogeneity across movie characterstics:

* Franchise Movies:
    * Pre-release volume elasticity of 0.17 $\rightarrow$ Buzz
    * Largest for blockbusters, elasticity of 0.34
* Non-Franchise:
    * Small movies $\rightarrow$ information diffusion
        * Post-release sentument elasticity of 0.7
    * Medium tier $\rightarrow$ growing awareness
        * Post-release volume Elasticity of 0.23

* Managerial Implication: Different type of products have different channels thru which WoM matters

# Does Online Word-of-Mouth Increase Demand? (and How?) Evidence from a Natural Experiment

---
# Online WoM Redux

**Motivation**: Causal inference is particularly difficult in the realm of online WOM due to the fact that
firms are not directly in control of the amount of WOM.

**Specific Questions**:

* What is the demand elasticity of demand wrt volume of posts?
* What is the mechanism through which online WoM influences choice?

**How?**: Natural experiment -- shutdown if Sina Weibo due to political events in mainland China but not HK

* Sina Weibo $\approx$ Chinese Twitter

---
# Empirical Approach

**Industry**: TV show viewership -- soapies

* Not really **new** products

**Data**:

* TV ratings (i.e. viewership) at episode/city level in mainland China and HK
* Microblogging activity about each show

**The Natural Experiment**: Censorship block on Sina Weibo

* Large, random shock, unrelated to TV
* Block in mainland China, **but not** HK

---
# Difference in Differences

$$
LogRating_{jt} = \alpha Block_{t} \beta Block_{t} + Mainland_{j} + \delta_j + Weekday_t' \gamma + \varepsilon_{jt}
$$

For causality ...

* Valid Counterfactual: HK approximates China
* No Selection on Unobservables: Nothing unobserved driving treatment

# Takeaways

* Estimated Volume elasticity: between 0.016 and 0.026

* WoM influnces demand via consumption complementarities 
  * Can chat about it later online

* Managerial Implications:
  * Fostering post-show discussion
  * Doesn't appear to be valence effects 
    * (maybe because quality is known?)
